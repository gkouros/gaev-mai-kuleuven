abstract = {John Holland has shown that when adaptive algorithms are used to search certain kinds of extremely large problem spaces, they will converge on a "good" solution fairly quickly. Such problem spaces are characterized by a low degree of epistasis. A host of classical search problems, however, are epistatic in nature. The present paper describes some new techniques for applying adaptive algorithms to epistatic domains, while retaining some of the strength of Holland's convergence proof. These techniques are described for two-dimensional bin-packing problems, and summarized for graph coloring problems. What makes these problems amenable to an adaptive approach is a two-stage evaluation procedure. Encodings of solutions are mutated and reproduced as they are in non-epistatic domains, but their evaluation is carried out after a decoding process. Using the techniques described, convergence is promoted in two ways: one of the natural mutation operators is a weaker version of Holland's crossover, and domain knowledge may be built into decoding processes so that the size of the search space is radically cut down.},

abstract="This paper presents an empirical study of population diversity measures and adaptive control of diversity in the context of a permutation-based algorithm for Traveling Salesman Problems and Vehicle Routing Problems. We provide detailed graphical observations and discussion of the relationship among the four diversity measures and suggest a moderate correlation between diversity and search performance under simple conditions. We also study the effects of adapting key genetic control parameters such as crossover and mutation rates on the population diversity. We are able to show that adaptive control of the genetic operations based on population diversity effectively outperforms fixed parameter genetic algorithms.",

 abstract = {The traveling-salesman problem is a generalized form of the simple problem to find the smallest closed loop that connects a number of points in a plane. Efforts in the past to find an efficient method for solving it have met with only partial success. The present paper describes a method of solution that has the following properties: (a) It is applicable to both symmetric and asymmetric problems with random elements. (b) It does not use subjective decisions, so that it can be completely mechanized. (c) It is appreciably faster than any other method proposed. (d) It can be terminated at any point where the solution obtained so far is deemed sufficiently accurate.},
